Interactivity and User Engagement: Unlike a static traditional CV, the website invites user interaction through clickable tabs and navigation bars, allowing for a dynamic exploration of content. The inclusion of software proficiency icons encourages users to engage with the content, potentially offering tooltips or modals for deeper insight into proficiency levels and specific project involvement.

Visual and Aesthetic Appeal: The website harnesses the full potential of modern web design with high-resolution imagery, sophisticated color schemes, and elegant fonts that elevate the visual experience beyond the black-and-white simplicity of a paper CV.

Personal Branding: The welcome page with a personal photograph and a casual backdrop gives a glimpse into Yibin Feng's personality, making her profile memorable and distinct. This personal touch fosters a connection with the visitor, presenting her not just as a professional entity but as a person with a vibrant life outside of work.

Information Architecture: The website's layout demonstrates a thoughtfully constructed information architecture, with a focus on user-friendly navigation that showcases Yibin Feng's academic credentials, work experiences, and technical skills in a coherent story flow, which is often challenging to achieve in a traditional CV's linear format.

Multimedia Utilization: By leveraging multimedia elements, the website can potentially showcase Feng's projects through videos, image galleries, or interactive presentations, which are impossible to include in a traditional CV but can significantly enhance understanding and appreciation of her work.

Expandability and Updates: Unlike a printed CV, the website's content can be continuously updated and expanded without the physical constraints of paper, allowing Feng to quickly adapt her portfolio to include new skills, projects, and achievements.

Networking and Social Integration: The platform likely includes the potential for integration with professional networking sites like LinkedIn or GitHub, providing a seamless bridge between the website and other professional profiles, thus enhancing opportunities for networking and collaboration.

Performance and Analysis: A digital platform can utilize analytics to gauge visitor interest, such as which sections are most visited, allowing Feng to refine and optimize her presentation according to user interest.
